# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 6, 2026**

Welcome to **Nebula Core Restore**. Your privacy is paramount to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.

### 1. Data Collection
Nebula Core Restore is designed as a privacy-first smart switching application. 
- **Local Data**: Most of your settings, including switch nicknames and theme preferences, are stored locally on your device.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: We use Firebase to synchronize switch states, hardware names, and voltage calibration data across your devices. This data is linked to your authorized Google account.
- **Location Data**: The app may request location access solely to provide local weather information and optimize device connectivity. We do not track or store your historical movement.

### 2. Data Usage
We use the collected data to:
- Provide real-time control and monitoring of your smart switches.
- Synchronize your personalized settings (like voltage calibration) across all your Android devices.
- Improve app performance and reliability through anonymized crash reports.

### 3. Data Protection
We implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard your information:
- **Encryption**: All communication with Firebase is encrypted via SSL/TLS.
- **Authentication**: Access to your device data is restricted to your authenticated Google account.

### 4. Third-Party Services
We utilize the following third-party services:
- **Google Firebase**: For real-time data synchronization and authentication.
- **Google Fonts**: For rendering our premium user interface.

### 5. Your Choices
You can clear your local cache or perform a full factory reset at any time via the **Maintenance** section in the Settings screen. This will remove all local data and configurations.

### 6. Contact Us
