# 🚀 NEBULA CORE - Release Checklist

## ✅ What Works WITHOUT Any Setup

These features work **immediately** - just build and run:

1. ✅ **Local Switch Control** - Tap switches, they toggle
2. ✅ **MQTT Communication** - Connects to public broker automatically
3. ✅ **ESP32 Code Generation** - Generate firmware code
4. ✅ **Scheduling** - Create and manage schedules
5. ✅ **Voice Feedback (TTS)** - AI speaks when switches toggle
6. ✅ **Themes** - All 3 themes work
7. ✅ **UI/UX** - All animations and interactions
8. ✅ **Robo Assistant** - All animations work

## ⚠️ What Requires Setup

### 1. Firebase (For Google Sign-In & Google Home)

**Required Files:**
- `android/app/google-services.json` (download from Firebase Console)
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (download from Firebase Console)

**Required Code Changes:**
- Uncomment Firebase plugin in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Add Firebase dependencies (already in pubspec.yaml)
- Run `pod install` for iOS

**Time Required:** 30 minutes

### 2. Google Assistant (Voice Commands)

**Required:**
- ✅ Permissions already added to AndroidManifest.xml
- ✅ Permissions already added to Info.plist
- ✅ Code already implemented

**What You Need to Do:**
- **NOTHING!** Just test on real device (simulator doesn't support microphone)

### 3. Google Home Integration

**Required:**
- ✅ Firebase setup (see above)
- ✅ User signs in with Google
- ✅ Code already implemented

**What You Need to Do:**
- Set up Firebase
- Users link Google Home in app (one tap)

## 📋 Step-by-Step Release Process

### Option A: Release WITHOUT Firebase (Local Mode Only)

**Perfect for:**
- Testing
- Local use only
- No Google services needed

**Steps:**
1. ✅ Build app: `flutter build apk` or `flutter build ios`
2. ✅ Test locally
3. ✅ Release to stores
4. ✅ Done!

**What Works:**
- All local features
- MQTT communication
- ESP32 code generation
- Scheduling
- Voice feedback
- Everything except Google Sign-In and Google Home sync

---

### Option B: Release WITH Firebase (Full Features)

**Perfect for:**
- Production release
- Google Home integration
- Cloud sync

**Steps:**

#### 1. Set Up Firebase (30 min)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create new project: "Nebula Core"
3. Add Android app:
   - Package: `com.example.nebula_core` (check your build.gradle.kts)
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Place in: `android/app/google-services.json`
4. Add iOS app (if releasing iOS):
   - Bundle ID: Check `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
   - Place in: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
5. Enable Authentication:
   - Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
   - Enable "Google"
6. Enable Firestore:
   - Firebase Console → Firestore Database
   - Create database (Test mode for dev, Production for release)

#### 2. Update Android Build Files (5 min)

**File: `android/app/build.gradle.kts`**
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("kotlin-android")
    id("dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin")
    id("com.google.gms.google-services") // UNCOMMENT THIS
}

dependencies {
    // Add these if not present:
    implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.7.0"))
    implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-auth")
    implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-firestore")
}
```

**File: `android/build.gradle.kts`**
```kotlin
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0") // ADD THIS
    }
}
```

#### 3. Update iOS (if releasing iOS) (5 min)

**File: `ios/Podfile`**
```ruby
platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'Runner' do
  pod 'Firebase/Auth'
  pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
end
```

Then run:
```bash
cd ios
pod install
```

#### 4. Get SHA-1 Fingerprint (Android) (2 min)

For debug:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew signingReport
```

For release:
```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

Add SHA-1 to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Your Android App

#### 5. Build and Test (10 min)

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release  # or flutter build ios --release
```

Test:
- ✅ Google Sign-In works
- ✅ Google Home linking works
- ✅ Google Assistant voice commands work
- ✅ All local features work

#### 6. Release! 🎉

## 🔍 How Each Feature Works

### Local Mode (No Setup)
```
User opens app
    ↓
App connects to MQTT broker (public)
    ↓
User toggles switch
    ↓
MQTT message sent to ESP32
    ↓
ESP32 controls physical switch
    ↓
Done! ✅
```

### Google Sign-In (Requires Firebase)
```
User taps "Sign in with Google"
    ↓
Firebase Auth opens Google Sign-In
    ↓
User selects account
    ↓
Firebase creates authenticated user
    ↓
User logged in ✅
```

### Google Home Sync (Requires Firebase)
```
User toggles switch
    ↓
Switch state changes locally
    ↓
MQTT message sent to ESP32
    ↓
GoogleHomeService syncs to Firestore
    ↓
Google Home app sees change
    ↓
Bidirectional sync ✅
```

### Google Assistant (No Setup, Just Permissions)
```
User taps Assistant pill
    ↓
Permission requested (first time)
    ↓
User grants microphone access
